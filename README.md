# ifcfile-to-graph

ifcfile-to-graph is an Azure Functionsâ€“based backend that processes Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files and converts them into a JSON graph representation. 
The graph includes nodes for IFC entities and edges for relationships between them. 

The core logic is implemented in the process_to_graph.py script which uses the IfcOpenShell library (https://ifcopenshell.org/).

## Getting Started

### Local Setup

1. Clone the Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ifcfile-to-graph.git
   cd ifcfile-to-graph

2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. (optional) Download and Extract IfcOpenShell (Manual Step):

   You might need to download latest ifc libraries, here for example: https://ifcopenshell.org/downloads.html

4. Run Locally:

   Use the Azure Functions Core Tools to run the function locally:

   func start

   Your endpoints (such as /api/upload and /api/health) should now be accessible (default port: 7071).

### Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to Azure Functions using GitHub Actions. 
The workflow .github/workflows/main_ifcfile-to-graph.yml deploys new version to Azure.
The workflow file is generated automatically during Azure Function setup pointing to this repo.
One step was added to the default workflow - "Download and extract IfcOpenShell" - it add ifcopenshell libraries.

### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile is provided for container-based deployments on Azure Functions. This Dockerfile builds an image that includes the Azure Functions runtime along with your code and IfcOpenShell. To build and run locally:

   docker build -t ifcfile-to-graph:latest .
   docker run -p 7071:80 ifcfile-to-graph:latest

Then test your endpoints via http://localhost:7071/api/upload and http://localhost:7071/api/health.

## Endpoints

- /api/health:
  A simple health-check endpoint.

- /api/upload:
  Accepts a multipart/form-data file upload (field name: file). Processes the IFC file, converts it to a graph, and returns the JSON representation.
